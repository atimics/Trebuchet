// updateCheck.js
//
// Pure helpers used by main.js for the "Check for Updates" feature.
// Lives here, separate from main.js, so it can be imported and tested
// directly without pulling in Electron — main.js imports 'electron'
// at the top, which means any test that imports main.js needs a full
// Electron runtime. Splitting the testable parts out matches the
// pattern used by rpcConfig.js, secretStore.js, etc.
//
// main.js wires these into the GitHub API call (httpsGetJson there)
// and the menu handler. Anything that touches the network, the
// BrowserWindow, app.getVersion(), or process.platform/arch stays
// in main.js — those would be harder to test cleanly and aren't
// where bugs are likely to hide.

 *
 * Returns 1 if a is newer than b, -1 if older, 0 if equal. Missing
 * components are treated as zero, so "1.0" equals "1.0.0".
 *
 * We don't need full semver pre-release/build-metadata handling —
 * our release tags are always clean N.N.N. If that ever changes
 * (e.g. we start tagging "1.0.0-rc1"), revisit this — the
 * `parseInt(n, 10) || 0` line will swallow the "-rc1" suffix and
 * incorrectly treat the rc as equal to the GA.

/**
 * Pick the release asset that matches a given platform/arch combo.
 *
 * Takes the assets[] array from the GitHub releases API and returns
 * the matching asset object (with .name and .browser_download_url),
 * or undefined if no asset matches.
 *
 * The matching is by regex on the filename rather than constructing
 * an exact name — that way the check stays robust if the version
 * portion of the filename changes, or if electron-builder ever
 * tweaks its default naming for one of our targets.
 *
 * Per-platform/arch rules:
 *
 *   win32  →  Portable .exe (matches the website's Windows default —
 *             nothing to install, just double-click and run).
 *
 *   darwin →  arch matters! arm64 and x64 DMGs are different binaries.
 *             Picking the wrong one gives the user a file that won't
 *             run, with a confusing error. This is the one place we
 *             absolutely cannot fall back to a default.
 *
 *   linux  →  AppImage. Universal-across-distros, doesn't require
 *             root, doesn't touch the package manager. We also ship
 *             a .deb, but the AppImage is the safe default for an
 *             auto-recommendation.
 *
 *   anything else → undefined. The caller treats this as the
 *                   "no-asset" status and routes the user to the
 *                   GitHub release page to choose manually.
 *
 * Parameterising platform/arch (rather than reading process.platform
 * inline) keeps this testable from any host — Linux CI can verify
 * the macOS arm64 case without faking globals.

 *
 * Takes the array returned by GitHub's /repos/:owner/:repo/releases
 * endpoint and returns the first release that isn't a draft, or null
 * if none qualifies. Prereleases ARE included.
 *
 * Why we don't use /releases/latest:
 *   GitHub's /releases/latest endpoint is documented as "the most
 *   recent non-prerelease, non-draft release". Trebuchet's publish
 *   script (scripts/publish-release.mjs) marks releases as
 *   --prerelease whenever any artifact has trust = 'unsigned test
 *   artifact', which is true for every release until code-signing
 *   certs are set up (Apple Developer ID, Windows EV). So
 *   /releases/latest returns 404 — there's no non-prerelease release
 *   to return — and the update check silently fails.
 *
 *   Fetching /releases instead returns the full list (sorted newest-
 *   first by default), and we apply our own filter that treats
 *   prereleases as legitimate updates. Users who installed the
 *   "prerelease" build are by definition fine with prerelease builds.
 *
 * Drafts are skipped defensively. In practice GitHub hides drafts
 * from unauthenticated requests, so the input array shouldn't
 * contain any — but we filter just in case authentication is ever
 * added.
